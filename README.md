# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi, I'm T Grashaw. I like to work with web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well
as using Object oriented languages like Java and C#. I also have a decent understanding of Sequel and
Python, but I haven't done quite as much with those project wise. Last thing I would like to say is that 
I've done a lot of work with concurrency, and believe that one day languages that incorporate concurecy 
oriented features may become very common place (such as Pony). If you don't know what Pony is, or have a 
decent understanding of concurrency, I highly recommend reading up on it.
